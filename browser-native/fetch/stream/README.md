upg idea: - load a timestamped packeted gif or jpg stream... replacing the current image with the approrate item at the approrate time... cool.. could do audio too this way.

> perhaps simple audio/video frames would be a better format online based tools?  (easier to edit/etc)
	- and/or a simple vnc like format for compression? (by what has changed.. espl for screen casts)

> a 'seek' feature would be nice so can skip to different portions of data. (skip at least.. or even cooler if can revert to previous load sections)
